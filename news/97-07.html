<h2>Toolkit news for July, 1997</h2>

Although I have made great strides in re-implementation, the toolkit
is not where I had hoped it would be.
The good news is:
<ul>
<li>The bulk of the toolkit's functionality has been re-implemented in
Standard&nbsp;ML.
Performance is good.
<li>Translation of matching statements works, and I've implemented a
couple of new optimizations so the toolkit generates much smaller
C&nbsp;files for some matching statements.
Problems that formerly required an hour to solve and generated
megabytes of code can now be solved in under a minute, and code
generated is a fraction of its former size.
Still, some performance problems remain.
<li>I can generate encoding procedures, although not yet with the
flexibility of the old toolkit.
<li>The rudiments of multiple-language support are there, and it should be
straightforward to support different implementation languages and
idioms. 
</ul>
Now the bad news:
<ul>
<li>Some matching statements are still costly to process.
Building a full Pentium disassembler takes 10&nbsp;minutes on a
Pentium&nbsp;133, and it requires <em>lots</em> of virtual memory.
There's an exponential algorithm that can't be avoided, but I have an
idea or two that might shrink the search space.
<li>There's no support for relocatable addresses in encoding procedures
yet.
<li>Lots of little features are missing.
<li>There's no command-line interface---you have to have full SML/NJ to do
anything.
</ul>
These flaws are all correctable, but I'm not sure when I'll have time
to address them.
Meanwhile, I'm sending out this notice, so if you've been having
performance problems with the toolkit, or if it doesn't support your
favorite programming language, you can let me know early.
When I do find time, I want to fix what's most pressing.
<p>
Thanks for your interest in the toolkit.
