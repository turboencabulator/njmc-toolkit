<h2>Toolkit news for November, 1996</h2>

Mary Fernandez now has full-time responsibilities at AT&amp;T, which
means she has very little time to devote to the toolkit.
Mary will continue to help maintain the toolkit, but unfortunately she
will not be able to be involved in new development to the extent that
she would like.
<p>
Norman Ramsey is now Research Assistant Professor in the Deparment of
Computer Science at the University of
Virginia.  
He works on the 
Zephyr project to
build a National Compiler Infrastructure and supports the toolkit as
time permits.

<p>

The toolkit's specification language is now called SLED, which stands
for Specification Language for Encoding and Decoding.
You'll see this acronym in our papers, and perhaps one day in the manual.

<p>

Version 0.5 contains many bug fixes, and it has some support for
automatic generation of assemblers and disassemblers.
