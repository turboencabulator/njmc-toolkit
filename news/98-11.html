<h2>Toolkit news for November, 1998</h2>

There have been few changes since <a href=97-07.html>July, 1997</a>.
It's still true that the ML version is useful for some things, and
it's equally true that it doesn't do everything that's in the official
Icon version (0.5).

<p>
Development on the toolkit is proceeding incrementally; much of the
code is being used in a processor for <a
href=/zephyr/csdl/lrtlindex.html>Lambda-RTL</a>. 
I'll announce further information as events warrant.
In the meantime, I am always happy to hear from users.
<p>
Thanks for your interest in the toolkit.
