 20. Extracted operand refers to match_word that's never declared.
     Rich Piazza, 11/21/96.  Led to change #49.

 19. If you use, as a free variable in a matching statement, a name
     designated relocatable, you'll be told about a failure to do with
     `rethinking projection'.  The workaround is to use a different
     name; since it's a binding instance, you can use any name you
     like. 

*18. In decoder, condition tests use match-word variables before
     they're defined. 9/96 Rich Piazza, 10/96 cc FIXED #43

*17. Nested instances don't get properly eliminated in matching
     statements. 10/18/96 cc FIXED #42

*16. Didn't correctly call assembly printer for constructor with no
     arguments. 8/13/96 FIXED #41

*15. Fits conditions not used to distinguish ``redundant'' disjuncts.
     Therefore all but the first disjunct gets thrown out, and then
     when a value doesn't fit, the toolkit goes belly-up at run time.
     Example: clv in the bytecode spec. 7/11/96.  FIXED #46

*14. Got pattern length wrong because of bad dagging.  
     Triggered by intlit x; bitshift == bitshiftlit x.  FIXED #38

*13. Some tests should be simplified away that aren't, e.g., testing
     that imm[0:15]! fits in 16 bits for MIPS li. FIXED AT UNKNOWN TIME.

*12. Impossible arms were trimmed silently if root node always matched
     --- didn't warn of unmatched disjuncts.  FIXED #20.

*11. In procedure tree() in tree.nw, initial root node needed empty
     children in order to make sense if first pattern always matched
     and node wasn't split. FIXED #19.
 
*10. Can't bind an address in a matching statement. FIXED, not sure when.
 
 *9. In bug09.nw, when constraints aren't satisfied we got an
     assert(0), even though we should get the 'else' clause. FIXED #21
 
 *8. Can't solve for offset in MIPS s.d; see bug08.nw. FIXED #18
 
 *7. Called Generate_C() even when -m3 given. FIXED #14.
 
 *6. Generate_M3() had an old bogus call. FIXED #12.
 
 *5. Emission code in procedure assumes $pc == cur_pc, neglecting the
     fact that cur_pc() advances as emit() is called.  FIXED #8.
 
 *4. Emission code for multiple tokens in closure doesn't properly
     advance location counter, so all tokens are emitted at dest_lc.
     FIXED #8.
 
 *3. Assertion failure in buffer_at_lc when writing empty relocatable block.
     FIXED #6.
 
 *2. Toolkit can't solve SPARC 
        | jmpl(dispA(rs1, simm13), rd) => RETURN FollowSet.T{GetReg(m, rs1)+simm13};
     because it doesn't eliminate disjuncts guarded by {DispA is indexA}
     and so on.  FIXED #4.
 
 *1. Toolkit doesn't accept a ! after a consructor arg.  Defined to be
     fixed until we get expressions as constructor args.
