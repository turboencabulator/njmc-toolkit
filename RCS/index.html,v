<h1>The New Jersey Machine-Code Toolkit</h1>

The New Jersey Machine-Code Toolkit
helps programmers write
applications that
process machine code---assemblers, disassemblers, 
code generators, tracers, profilers, and debuggers.
The toolkit is a joint project of 
<a href=http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~mff>Mary Fern&aacute;ndez</a>
<!-- http://www.research.att.com/orgs/ssr/people/maryf/ -->
and 
<a href=http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/nr>Norman Ramsey</a>.

<h2>Mailing lists</h2>

To keep up to date with the toolkit, you can send messages to the
authors at 
<tt><a href=mailto:toolkit@@cs.princeton.edu>toolkit@@cs.princeton.edu</a></tt>.
We also have two mailing lists about the toolkit;
<tt><a href=mailto:toolkit-interest@@cs.purdue.edu>toolkit-interest@@cs.purdue.edu</a></tt>
goes to people who have expressed some interest 
in the toolkit, and it carries most general announcements about the toolkit.
<tt><a href=mailto:toolkit-users@@cs.purdue.edu>toolkit-users@@cs.purdue.edu</a></tt>
goes to people who  are actually
using the toolkit, 
and it carries discussion among users.
You can subscribe by sending one of
<pre>
mailer add me to toolkit-interest
mailer add me to toolkit-users
</pre>
to <tt><a href=mailto:mailer@@cs.purdue.edu>mailer@@cs.purdue.edu</a></tt>.
The inverse operations are
<pre>
mailer delete me from toolkit-interest
mailer delete me from toolkit-users
</pre>
<p>
It's still a good idea to report problems to  
<tt><a href=mailto:toolkit@@cs.princeton.edu>toolkit@@cs.princeton.edu</a></tt>.



<h2>Version 0.4 (March 1996)</h2>

The toolkit is now in version&nbsp;0.4.
The primary reason for this new release is to enable users to validate
specifications using the <em>specification checker</em>.
The release includes these changes:
<ul>
<li>The checker described in our 
<a href=../pubs/tk-toplas.ps>overview paper</a> is included.

<li>The reference manual now describes how to use the toolkit to emit
assembly language as well as binary.  This feature was in the last
release but not in the manual.

<li>The examples directory now includes a rudimentary disassembler for
the SPARC.  Thanks to 
<a href=http://www.cs.utas.edu.au/Staff/Cifuentes,Cristina/CNC.html>Cristina
Cifuentes</a> for providing the impetus.

<li>We have validated our specifications and corrected a handful of
lingering bugs.

<li>It is now possible to use <code>_</code> in expressions as a true
``wildcard'' value.  
Unlike in previous releases, different instances of <code>_</code> are
really different, even if they appear in the same arm of a matching statement.
It works by representing a different, otherwise
unnameable variable at each instance.
Suggested uses include:
<menu>
<li>Use it in matching statements for uninteresting arguments to constructors.
<li>To constrain value <code>n</code> to be a multiple of 4, write the
    equation <code>n&nbsp;=&nbsp;4&nbsp;*&nbsp;_</code>.
</menu>

<li>We have better diagnostics to help you figure out what is wrong
when you write a matching statement and some arms never match.

<li>We have fixed some more bugs, including an insidious bug with
names in matching statements.

<li>We have added a few procedures to the toolkit's library.

<li>We have introduced new bugs.
</ul>

We are now saving
<a href=oldnews.html>release notes from previous versions of the
toolkit</a>.


<h2>Distribution</h2>

If you think you might want to use the toolkit, 
a <a href=src/refman.ps>reference
manual</a> and <a href=readme.html>source distribution</a> are available.
There are annotated specifications
(read the 
<a href=specs/specs.ps>report</a>
or browse the <a href=specs>source directory</a>
 for the <a href=specs/mips.nw>MIPS</a>, <a href=specs/sparc.nw>SPARC</a>, 
and <a href=specs/pentium.nw>Intel Pentium</a>, which
show how to use the toolkit to describe real machines.
There is also an unannotated specification for the <a
href=specs/ppc.nw>PowerPC 604</a>.
Finally there is a <a href=examples/xs/index.html>toy example</a> that
will give you more ideas about how to build applications, and there is
a <a href=examples/sparc/index.html>rudimentary disassembler for the
SPARC</a> that you may find useful.



<h2>Papers</h2>

There are two papers describing the main ideas:

<br>
This is a comprehensive journal paper on the toolkit.
It includes major sections on the toolkit's specification language,
what it's like to use the toolkit, and how the toolkit is implemented.
</ul>
Those who actually want to use the toolkit will probably find the
following technical reports useful:
<ul>
<li><a href=http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/nr>Norman Ramsey</a> and
<a href=http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~mff>Mary Fern&aacute;ndez</a>.

Jersey Machine-Code Toolkit architecture specifications.</a>
Technical Report TR-470-94, Department of Computer Science, Princeton
University, October 1994.
<br>
These annotated descriptions of the MIPS, SPARC, and Intel Pentium
show the toolkit's specification language in action.
Highly recommended for anyone planning to write machine descriptions
for the toolkit.

The manual describes the complete specification language and explains
how to use version 0.2.

The toolkit project has also led to a machine-independent method of
relocating instructions, described in
<blockquote>

The toolkit's equation solver is described in
